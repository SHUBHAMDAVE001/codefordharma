## **Code for Dharma Initiative**

> **Building IT Ecosystem to mark a strong presence of Dharma in the digital world.**

### 1. Introduction

**Code for Dharma** is a “**Not for Profit**” initiative. We are a team of like minded and dedicated software developers who want to contribute our part of **Dharma**. We are passionate about Code, Computers and Dharma, therefore have an aim of working for all of them.

As Hinduism/Sanatan Dharma presence is not so strong in the digital world, we are taking this responsibility to present the right content in the right way about Dharma. Also, we aspire to make Dharma **self dependent** and **competitive** in the field of Information Technology.

### 2. Answering the 3 W’s

{% tab title="What?" %}
What do we want to achieve from this initiative?

This initiative is to build a strong community of software developers to build world class softwares for Dharma and have a vision to make Sanatan Dharma independent in the field of Information Technology to deal with international threats in the IT field. Also, we aim to support ongoing online/digital initiatives for Santan Dharma to avoid redundancy of tasks and to strengthen the **Sanatan Ecosystem**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Why?" %}
Why do we need to do this?

* There are so many indegenous softwares already present in the market who are working for Sanatan Dharma but they do not stand with the world class standards. Goal of this initiative is to design and develop **world class products** for Dharma.
* As we are in the age of IT, we need to present the right content in the right way i.e. to make Sanatan Dharma information accessible to all in its purest form rather than interpretations and fake propagandas.
* The dependency of Sanatan Dharmi/Hindus on international free softwares like whatsapp, facebook, Google may start exploitation at a later stage. Revision of recent Whatsapp guidelines to use personal data is one among the potential exploitations. We aim to protect sanatanis from any such exploitation and to make Dharma independent in the IT field.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="How?" %}
How are we going to achieve our goals?

* We aim to unite Sanatanis at grassroot level.
* People with the best knowledge about coding are themselves coming forward to join us to contribute their part of Dharma and Patriotism.
* We belong to a civilization which was a pioneer in having advanced technologies, so we as the descendants are capable of carrying the legacy further.
* We are going to create complete user focused online platforms to achieve goals of Dharma.
