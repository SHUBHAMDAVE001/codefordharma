## 3. History

1. With this platform, we aim to redefine Indian history based on original facts and proofs to counter the written history motivated by propaganda. During British rule, the Britishers kept on asserting themselves as a race superior to that of Indians/sanatanis. Our vision though this platform is to make people aware about the glorious past of the Sanatanis and to restore the confidence of Sanatanis as a race which has been lost over the past due to various other reasons.
2. We are already working to connect the Sanatani Historians all over the globe to work in a collaborative manner in this regard.
3. This platform shall be particularly useful for Sanatanis settled outside India to recognize their racial roots and to be truly aware about their history.
