<!-- # Temples Ecosystem -->

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Objective

Our objective as an organization is aiming to create an environment where our temples are free from any kind of exploitation through modern means and tactics.

We are creating an ecosystem to re-identify our culture, our land, megastructures and every possible structure related to our temple and its environment to present a correct and right perspective of the Sanatan Culture.

To protect our temples from exploitation, we have come up with this platform to re-establish our Temple Ecosystem and all the aspects related to our temples.

## 3. Temple Encyclopedia

Initiatives which we are focusing on:

1. Collecting information about all the existing Sanatan Dharma Temples, their deities, culture, history & devotional stories in one place thereby creating an interconnected repository.
2. Our \#LostTemple initiative will find temples which we have lost & document them for a better understanding.
3. Our \#ReclaimTemple initiative will list all the temples that were destroyed by invasion and collect all the information related to them.
4. Recording all the temple's information in one place as an encyclopedia which will help people to learn about Sanatan culture & history and will enable effective research in this field.
5. We aim to connect with all the people who are connected with their local temples thereby creating a support system for our initiative\(s\).
6. We want to connect every Sanatani across the world, through our platform.

## 4. Movements

### 4.1 \#FreeTemples Movement

- Our temples which hold a huge reservoir of our donations in form of cash, gold and gems are indirectly controlled/interfered in by Govt. of India/State Govts./Local Bodies and this is primarily practised for temples whereas keeping the secular nature of the constitution of India in mind, religion is not a matter of the state to deal with which the govts. should adhere to.
- We aim to create a movement to limit/end the interference and reclaim our existing temples from the government through legal channels within the limits of the Constitution of India. Sanatan Dharma temples should be free from any political interference.

### 4.2 \#LostTemples Movement

- Many of our megastructures are situated in the middle of the jungles, high altitude mountainous terrains or in deserted lands.
- Aforementioned structures or temples were once prosperous and had a well-established city around them. However, when the invaders looted all the wealth and destroyed our ecosystem, the native people were left with no other option than to abandon the looted city and to scatter at various places.
- The temples’ structure have remained there for 100s of years now and we are working day and night to retain our lost and forgotten beautiful temples.

### 4.3 \#DeitiesTheft Movement

- According to a study, over 1,000 artefacts are stolen and smuggled every year from Indian temples.
- We are also working to get back our deities which are estimated to be worth billions of dollars by western countries. Those deities are precious for us and are worth much more than their monetary value.

### 4.4 \#ProtectPujaries & \#ProtectSadhus

- We often hear of news regarding atrocities on Sadhus/Pujaries through news channels like how a poor Sadhu/Pujari was burnt alive for protecting his temple from a builder, or we can see how a Pujari was beaten to death because he was wearing his traditional saffron outfit.
- We need to protect and raise voice against every incident doing unjust to our Gurus, our Sages as they are the building blocks of our ecosystem.
- We aim to create the right image and respect for Sanatan Saints/religious preachers which has been tarnished over the years due to various unfortunate incidents.

## 5. Teams

### 5.1 Pujaries

- Pujaries/Saints/Gurus, are our guide to Dharma, they are the ones who will show us the right path and teach about every aspect of Sanatan Dharma.
- Our motive is to collect information and then to connect the best Saints with their Sishyas so that they can provide them with their best knowledge of Dharma.
- Their best shishyas will further carry the legacy to teach and spread the Dharma to furthermore Sanatanis in the world. To be a Guru one needs to be excellent in the particular field.
- Pujaries should also be trained in Modern education along with traditional education.

### 5.2 Lawyers

- We aim to bring lawyers to one platform so that they can help each other to fight for Temples & Deities through proper legal channels and also to help and guide us about legal issues.
- These lawyers will represent the cases related to temple reclamation and bringing back Deities on a legal basis and help to attain our heritage constitutionally.
- We also aim to provide legal help to the people who are being prejudiced on the basis of Sanatan Dharma as their religion.

### 5.3 Content Writers

- We are looking forward towards building a community which will help us/our teams to express our thoughts in the right words and proper format.
- Our Content Writer team will work on preparing the unique content on temples and their culture, to express our ecosystem and the destruction caused to it over 2000 years.
- The team will further work on translating the content in all the native languages as we are diverse in culture and have many languages spoken across Bharat. This will help the readers to read all our 1,000s of years old cultural and historical information, all of Scientific, Mathematical and Architectural data which the Western world is formulating now.

### 5.4 Digital Content Creators

- Our content team is working to produce quality photographs & video content for our Viewers.
- This content will help the viewers to learn a lot about the local ecosystem of the temples, the folk tales and the history of the temples, the important aspects and the reasons behind demolition/decay of temples in an interactive and interesting manner so that even Sanatani kids can learn about their culture at early stages of their life.
- We will be building documentaries of all of our great temples showcasing all important aspects from art to architecture.

### 5.5 Temples Management Board

- We are an organisation which is working to unite the scattered stakeholders of Sanatan Dharma with aim to unite and keep all the temples updated and associated with each other. This will ensure smooth working for all sanatan temples.
- This also will help to raise a strong voice against any injustice which might happen to our temples and structures in future.
- This board will help organise our collective efforts for building the Temple Ecosystem. However, we have no aim to control any temple premises.
- Board members will be elected in a democratic manner.

### 5.6 Temple Security Force

- As our temples are getting looted & destroyed since the past 2,000 years, we propose a strong security force to defend and protect the temples as the government has failed to provide security in several cases. The security force shall be capable of protecting the ecosystem.

### 5.7 IT Team

- Sanatan Dharma is all about following the right thing and updating ourselves with progressive thoughts and actions. In ancient times, our Rishis \(saints\) also used to impart scientific knowledge and research. Rishi Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhatta are some of the prominent examples.
- In today's world of digital media, we aim to create an easy path of Dharma digitally i.e. to make people aware of Dharma using digital platforms.
- Sanatan Dharma does not deny the use of digital platforms and neither take it as a hindrance towards the path of Dharma.
- Our IT team will do all the necessary activities to uphold Dharma in digital platforms and make every content available to the end user Sanatani.

## 6. Services

### 6.1 Gurukuls

- We all know that the ancient Sanatanis had a beautiful and advanced teaching structure where students of different age groups used to learn all life skills. Subjects like "Ganit", "Bhugol", "Itihas", "Shastra", "Vedas", and all the knowledge was taught by respective Gurus.
- This system of advanced education through Gurukuls became almost extinct and contributed to decay of our age-old culture. We in our organization are working to bring back the Gurukul system.
- Things which will be focused on apart from practical and subject knowledge will include Personality development, Self Defence, Multilingual knowledge and shishyas shall also be taught to focus on other life skills.
- Apart from ancient education, we are going to provide all the Modern Education as well and make the shishyas employable as per the best market practices.

### 6.2 Gaushala

- Sanatan Dharma considers Gau as Mata. We see the entire universe in Gau Mata. Needless to say that everything which Gau Mata gives us is for our utility.
- We are focusing on building more and more gaushalas and to train people to take care of our Gau Mata and to ensure their good health and safety.
- We also aim to make the Gaushala ecosystem self-sustaining as every product or by product of cows is useful for society.

### 6.4 Mother Nature Protection

- Due to increasing competitiveness in the growth oriented world, mother nature is getting exploited in a manner getting worse day by day. Now the western countries are slowly realizing what values Sanatan Dharma has as a community and why we praise mother nature.
- To protect mother nature is also our motive and this objective involves educating children about "Prakriti Sanrakshan", we aim to plant more and more trees. Rejuvenating rivers will also be taken care of.
- We are also planning to focus on organic farming to protect the exploitation of soil as a resource and to avoid the consumption of harmful chemicals.
