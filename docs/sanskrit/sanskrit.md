## 1. Introduction

As we all know Sanskrit is a very profound language which is quite rich in vocabulary, literature and thoughts. Sanskrit is the oldest and most continually used language in the world. Sanskrit has the most enriched Grammar amongst all the languages of the world. Apart from Indian Languages, many of the words of European languages are derived from Sanskrit. As per the research work done by Dr. James Hartzell, people who memorize long Sanskrit texts have brains that literally expand and become better with sharper memory and cognitive skills. Sanskrit as a language is taught in several Indian and International universities.

For Computers, Sanskrit is a language whose grammar can be easily translated to a form understandable by a computer and accordingly has a great potential for natural Language Processing.

“C4D Sanskrit” is a platform with aim to make Sanskrit a mainstream language. We aim to bring all the people working for sanskrit in the field of literature as well as computers on a single platform.

## Answering 3 W’s

### What?

We aim to bring all the people working on sanskrit on one platform to make sanskrit a mainstream language.

### Why?

- As sanskrit is our ancestors' legacy, we need to make future generations aware about the richness of sanskrit and to initiate a feeling of pride regarding sanskrit which has deteriorated over the past several centuries due to various reasons
- As per research, Promoting sanskrit helps in the development of the brain. Accordingly, learning Sanskrit grammar improves command over the other languages too.
- Sanskrit texts need to be preserved as a heritage as ancient Sanskrit texts are a treasure to the Indian literature.

### How?

Our sanskrit Platform includes the following initiatives

- Sanskrit Digitization Project
- Sanskrit data Bank
- Sanskrit Knowledge Sharing Platform
- Sanskrit learning application
- Sanskrit for Computers

## Sanskrit Digitization Project

- There are numerous physical Sanskrit manuscripts in different libraries which are disintegrating as their proper care is not taken off.
- With this ambitious project, we aim to collect all ancient Sanskrit manuscripts, scan them and to convert them in digital text so that they can be saved in digital form and the IT footprint of Sanskrit as a language can be improved exponentially.

## Sanskrit Data Bank \(SDB\)

- With this initiative, we aim to get all Sanskrit texts at one platform in digital form.
- The sanskrit texts will be translated in all Indian languages as well as popular foreign languages by a team of Sanskrit scholars so that they can be translated with their correct meaning in the right context. This will help in countering the Sanskrit translations which have been done by the people of foreign origin as any translation is subject to interpretations.
- We aim to create a Sanskrit Data Bank which may serve as a base to help people to do research and shall make Sanskrit texts available online for the people interested in studying them.

## Sanskrit Knowledge Sharing Platform

- With this platform, we aim to bring all the Sanskrit researchers in literature as well as technology at one platform to enable collaborative work to be done at a single platform.
- This platform may also be helpful in reducing the redundancy of efforts for the people who are working at different levels for establishing Sanskrit as a mainstream language. A joint effort may give a strong push for the common goal of several people.
- We also aim to bring Sanskrit educational institutions and Universities at one place to facilitate research and knowledge sharing with each other.
- Latest developments and achievements made regarding Sanskrit shall be made available to interested users to keep themselves updated.

## Sanskrit Learning Application

- We aim to develop an application/platform to enable people to learn Sanskrit online.
- The platform shall be helpful for people of any origin and speaking any language to learn Sanskrit through our application.
- We also aim to develop a Sanskrit web dictionary and world class Sanskrit translator to enable translation of Sanskrit to different Language as per the convenience of the user with the help of Natural Language Processing \(NLP\)

## Sanskrit for Computers

- Sanskrit is a language whose grammar can be easily translated to a form understandable by a computer.
- We have an ambitious aim to develop a programming language in Sanskrit Language which may be quite helpful for Information Technology in making Computer programming an easy task as coding can be enabled verbally due to enormous Natural Language Processing potential of Sanskrit.
