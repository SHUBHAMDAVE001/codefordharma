<!-- # History / Itihasa -->

## **1. Introduction**

**History is an integral part of any civilisation and the key to being successful as a civilisation lies in being aware of its “true” history. As per a famous English proverb “The stories shall glorify the hunters until the lions learn how to write.” Sanatanis as a civilisation are one of the oldest civilisations of the world with a history of more than 5,000 years and also have the richest cultural heritage.**

**The history taught in modern India is prejudiced against certain facts and we as Sanatanis are not aware of our true history which is full of glory and achievements. Primarily, the documentation of Indian history was initiated by Britishers during the time of their rule on Indian Sub-continent. As the prime motive of Britishers was to sustain their rule and organised loot in India, they were already prejudiced while writing the history. Accordingly, Sanatani history was written in such a manner that the supremacy of British as a race could be established and hence, Sanatanis were presented in the light of inferiority. The achievements of Sanatani history were either ignored or wilfully suppressed to make Indians a mental slave to the foreign race. In the same manner, the harsh events of sanatani history i.e. the foreign invasions were presented in a mild form. All this led the Sanatanis to lose their confidence over the time and ultimately led to India being an under developed nation.**

**We as the “Code for Dharma History” initiative have a vision to re-define Sanatnai history in the light of true facts rather than prejudiced interpretations and context. Our aim with this initiative is to make Sanatanis aware of their glorious past and to make them confident about the golden past of their race so that the true facts can come into light. Also, we aim to create a museum of forgotten Indian heroes with which the Sanatani history is full of.**

## **2. Historians**

**Several Sanatani historians are working continuously to bring out the real facts of the famous historical events and happenings with proofs. We through our initiative aim to bring all the sanatani historians on the same platform to reduce the redundancy of the task and to effectively re-write the history of Sanatanis as a civilisation based on true facts and numbers with proofs. Also, we aim for a collective effort to correct the history of Sanatanis which had been written with prejudices by foreigners and also to bring out the fake stories and propagandas.**

## **3. The History app**

**We aspire to create the History application where we aim to create a timeline web of real Indian history. The app will be a repository of Indian history in text form with valid proofs and also in an audio visual form in various Indian languages and foreign languages. A user will be able to visualise the historical facts in a 3 Dimensional mapping where the simultaneous events in the history can be visualised at the same place.**

## **4. Content Team**

**As a team, we are not only focussed on re-writing the history but also we aspire to present the history in an interactive manner. Through the content team, we aim to create interactive audio visuals, podcasts of our famous historical events. We also aim to create TV serials, web series of our famous historical heroes who have been forgotten over the time due to their misrepresentation in history. We also aim to create a timeline web of history which will be first of its kind. In the timeline web, a user will be able to visualise the historical facts in a 3 Dimensional mapping where the simultaneous events in the history can be visualised at the same place.**

## **5. Translators**

**As Sanatanis, we have one of the richest heritage in the world. We have several regional mainstream languages. We aim to translate the factually correct history in all the mainstream Indian languages and famous foreign languages so that the reach of the real historical events can be improved.**

## **6. Memorials and Museums**

**Sanatani heritage and history is full of heroes and motivational characters. We as Sanatanis need to preserve this heritage and keep our heroes alive in our memories. During the last several centuries, we have forgotten our heroes because of the history written with prejudices. There are numerous sanatani heroes who are alive till date in the local tales and songs. We aspire to create memorials of the Sanatani heroes and to establish the museums of Sanatani heritage at major locations in the country to make Sanatanis and the world aware about the glorious history and glorious heroes of Sanatan Sanskriti.**

## **7. Saving the Memorials**

**Sanatan heroes have left behind a rich cultural heritage in the form of famous forts and memorials. Several of these memorials are disintegrating due to lack of proper maintenance and ignorance of the government authorities. We aspire to save and manage these pillars of sanatan history and to maintain them so that the rich Sanatan heritage can be saved.**
