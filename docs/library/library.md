# Library

## **Introduction**

**Sanatanis and India as a civilisation has the world's richest heritage in the form of culture, literature, science and technology. Nalanda, Takshila and Vikramshila are believed to be among the oldest libraries and centres of education in the world where the students from various other countries used to come for studies. Sanatani knowledge has several important contributions in the field of medical science, astronomy, mathematics and literature.**

**We as Code for Dharma have come forward to save the Sanatani knowledge treasure by converting the same in digital form and also to prevent polarisation of Sanatani data in the hands of western companies**

## **The Sanatan Library:**

**We as Code for Dharma aspire to create the digital repository/library of all the ancient and modern sanatani knowledge. Due to negligence, sanatani knowledge in the form of manuscripts is getting decayed and destroyed because of lack of maintenance of ancient manuscripts.**

**We aim to collect the aforementioned knowledge originated in various Indian languages and to initially convert it in scanned form and subsequently to convert it in digital form so that the sanatani knowledge can be saved and can be used to make sanatanis aware of their literature and knowledge.**

**In the modern era, the data of the world is getting polarised in the hands of a few very large technology giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This as a practice is strictly not in the favour of sanatanis as the Sanatani Dharmic and scientific knowledge and literature is vulnerable at the hands of non-sanatanis. We aspire to be a platform entirely hosted on Dharmic infrastructure to provide security to Sanatani knowledge in the cyber world.**

## **Goals**

- **We aim to develop a world class application and platform for being the repository of Sanatani knowledge in the digital world.**
- **We aim to make all the ancient and modern sanatani books and scripts available in digital format**
- **To translate all the books in various Indian and famous foreign languages to spread awareness about the texts written in the regional languages including sanskrit. The books shall be translated by the experts in the language in which the book is originally written so that the translated version contains the original meaning of the texts rather than the translations done by the foreigners with preconceived notions and a constrained mindset.**
- **To make available the Sanatani knowledge in text, audio and video format to increase the user friendliness of the knowledge and to make it easy to understand.**
- **To safeguard the Sanatani knowledge by preventing it from cyber attacks and by hosting it on Dharmic infrastructure.**

## **Teams**

### **1. Sanskrit Team**

**We are working with a team of experts in Sanskrit language to collect the sanskrit manuscripts. The team is collecting, modifying and converting the knowledge in digital form and is also responsible for translating and converting the Sanskrit texts to other languages and vice versa**

### **2. Other Language Experts**

**Experts are working and translating original content of regional languages to other languages. We aim to acknowledge all the languages of the Sanatanis. Translating to other languages will help all the Sanatanis to use the data**

### **3. Graphic Designers**

**A team of graphic designers is working to make the platform interactive, interesting to make the user experience better. We aim to create the best digital platform for Sanatani knowledge as per the world class standards.**

### **4. IT and Development Team**

**Our IT team is responsible for the building and maintaining of the digital platform as per the specifications laid down by the experts.**

### **5. Promotion team for awareness**

**Our promotion team will create awareness campaigns regarding the platform to spread it to the maximum Sanatanis possible. Social Media presence will also be a major aspect here.**
