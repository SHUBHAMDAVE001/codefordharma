## **2. How to choose tech Stack**

**a. Easy to develop & maintain the code**

**b. Easy to deploy, scale and portable \(means code should not be too much bound to one cloud service provider and can be easily portable to other platform\)**

**c. cost should be minimal to null or only cost as much as we use it. As code for dharma is a non-profit entity.**

**d. Code should be containerised as every system is different from other in one way or another. \(use Docker for this\)**
