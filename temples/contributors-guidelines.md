## 1.Software Development

Currently we are using **Flutter** with **Firebase** for Buiding our app.

Code is privatly hosted on Gitlab.

our earlier prototype was on React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Google Cloud, but it was taking longer time for development so we moved out of this stack for now.

**NOTE**: Our long term goal is to build our own Cloud Infrastructre for all the work related to Dharma, but as we are low on investment, we are starting from whatever cheap we have, we will move sequencialy to our own cloud as we grow on later stage.
