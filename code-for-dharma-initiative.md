7. Introduction

Code for Dharma is a “Not for Profit” initiative. We are a team of like minded and dedicated software developers who want to contribute our part of Dharma. We are passionate about Code, Computers and Dharma, therefore have an aim of working for all of them.

As Hinduism/Sanatan Dharma presence is not so strong in the digital world, we are taking this responsibility to present the right content in the right way about Dharma. Also, we aspire to make Dharma self dependent and competitive in the field of Information Technology.

1. Answering the 3 W’s

   2.1 What?

What do we want to achieve from this initiative?

This initiative is to build a strong community of software developers to build world class softwares for Dharma and have a vision to make Sanatan Dharma independent in the field of Information Technology to deal with international threats in the IT field. Also, we aim to support ongoing online/digital initiatives for Santan Dharma to avoid redundancy of tasks and to strengthen the Sanatan Ecosystem.

2.2 Why?

Why do we need to do this?

* There are so many indegenous softwares already present in the market who are working for Sanatan Dharma but they do not stand with the world class standards. Goal of this initiative is to design and develop world class products for Dharma.
* As we are in the age of IT, we need to present the right content in the right way i.e. to make Sanatan Dharma information accessible to all in its purest form rather than interpretations and fake propagandas.
* The dependency of Sanatan Dharmi/Hindus on international free softwares like whatsapp, facebook, Google may start exploitation at a later stage. Revision of recent Whatsapp guidelines to use personal data is one among the potential exploitations. We aim to protect sanatanis from any such exploitation and to make Dharma independent in the IT field.

2.3 How?

How are we going to achieve our goals?

* We aim to unite Sanatanis at grassroot level.
* People with the best knowledge about coding are themselves coming forward to join us to contribute their part of Dharma and Patriotism.
* We belong to a civilization which was a pioneer in having advanced technologies, so we as the descendants are capable of carrying the legacy further.
* We are going to create complete user focused online platforms to achieve goals of Dharma. 

1. Teams

   3.1 Graphic Designers

We aim to build a team of young, vibrant and energetic Graphic Designers who are selflessly willing and are capable of giving a world class appearance to our Dharma Softwares

3.2 UI/UX Designers We aim to Build world class User Interfaces for Sanatan Softwares to give the best User Experience. 3.3 Software Developers

* We aim to build world class “Not for Profit” quality softwares to strengthen the Sanatan ecosystem.
* We aim to build softwares which are easy to develop & maintain, with least possible cost, secure, scalable and performant.
* We also aim to develop softwares for different Sanatan organisations on strictly “Not for Profit” basis. This will help different Sanatan Organisations to free themselves from exploitation of “For Profit” IT firms and to keep themselves focussed on their core area of work/competency.
* We aim to provide a free of cost “temple management software” to all leading temples around the world to save sanatan funds so that they can be utilised on betterment and upliftment of marginalised sanatanis  

  3.4 Content Managers

* We aim to develop a team of creative and experienced content managers from different fields to create, manage and monitor the online sanatan content in an efficient manner.
* Through our “Wiki” sub team, we aim to correct/delete all the wrongly presented data pertaining to sanatan Dharma on various digital platforms, primarily on Wikipedia.

3.5 Cyber Security

* Sanatan Dharma was under invasions and attacks by various forces. Likewise, online sanatan softwares and databases might be exposed to cyber attacks.
* We aim to build a team of world class sanatani cyber security experts to protect the Sanatan Ecosystem in the digital world.
* The cyber security  team will work to protect Sanatan infrastructure and sanatani user’s data from any kind of attack.

   4.3 History

10. With this platform, we aim to redefine Indian history based on original facts and proofs to counter the written history motivated by propaganda.
